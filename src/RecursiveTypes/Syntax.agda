-- A syntactic type uses De-Bruijn indices to refer to recursive references
-- introduced by μ-binders.  A Type is indexed by the number of free variables
-- in scope, and a Ref is restricted to only referring to one of those
-- variables.

  _⨯_ : (A B : Type n) → Type n
  _∨_ : (A B : Type n) → Type n

-- A substitution lemma: increment every reference in the type by one.  This is
-- used when a type is substituted into another type: every time the
-- substitution passes by a μ-binder, the variables this type referred to are
-- now an extra binder away, so all of the references must be incremented by
-- one.
